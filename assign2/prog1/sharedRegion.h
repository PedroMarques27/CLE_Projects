/**
 *  \file sharedRegion.h (interface file)
 *
 *  \brief Shared Region for the text processing.
 *
 *  Synchronization based on monitors.
 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a
 *  monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *
 *  Data transfer region implemented as a monitor.
 *
 *  This shared region will utilize the array of structures initialized by
 *  the main thread.
 * 
 *  Workers can access the shared region to obtain data to process from that
 *  array of structures. They can also store the partial results of the
 *  processing done.
 * 
 *  There is also a function to print out the final results, that should be
 *  used after there is no more data to be processed.
 * 
 *  Monitored Methods:
 *     \li getData - operation carried out by worker threads.
 *     \li savePartialResults - operation carried out by worker threads.
 *
 *  Unmonitored Methods:
 *     \li putInitialData - operation carried out by the main thread.
 *     \li printResults - operation carried out by the main thread.
