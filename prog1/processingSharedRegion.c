/**
 *  \file monitor.c (implementation file)
 *
 *  \brief
 *
 *  Synchronization based on monitors.
 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a
 *  monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *
 *  Shared region implemented as a monitor.
 *
 *  It keeps one array of fileData structures:
 *      file: char[] fileName, FILE fp, int bytesRead, double totalBytes, bool processed, int nWords (etc);
 *  One for storing data associated to reading the file, and the other for storing the results.
 *
 *  Monitored Functions:
 *    A worker can execute the function getData which will:
 *      Get a File from the list of Files to be processed.
 *      Read the last part of the chunk until it reaches a white space, separator or punctuation.
 *      Store the number of bytes read in addition to the chunksize.
 *      Increment by one the the current file index if the file has been fully read.
 *
 *      Return to the worker the fileName, the initial byte to start processing and the size to read.
 *
 *    A worker also publishes results with the function savePartialResults:
 *      Stores results associated to a File.
 *
 *  There is another function, getResults, which will return the results of each file.
