/**

 *
 *  \brief Shared Region for the text processing.
 *
 *  Synchronization based on monitors.
 *  Both threads and the monitor are implemented using the pthread library which enables the creation of a
 *  monitor of the Lampson / Redell type.
 *
 *  Data transfer region implemented as a monitor.
 *
 *  Monitored Methods:
 *     \li savePartialResults - operation carried out by worker threads.
 *     \li getData - operation carried out by worker threads.
 *
 *  Unmonitored Methods:
 *     \li initialData - operation carried out by the main thread.
 *     \li printResults - operation carried out by the main thread.
